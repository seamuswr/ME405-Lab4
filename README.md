What our team did during the lab period was to find the slowest rate for the motor control task without sacrificing the motor control performance. This can be seen when the plot of the step response dramatically changes. For example, when we kept increasing the control rate, the motor would start to overshoot when reaching the setpoint. The effect was amplified if the period of control increased. We adjusted the rate for the motor control task to where the motor started to overshoot and decreased the rate until the overshoot was diminished. Then, we lowered the rate more to account for a factor of safety. Hence, we recommend running the motor with a flywheel every 100 ms.
