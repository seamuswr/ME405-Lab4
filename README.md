What our team did during the lab period was to find slowest rate for the motor control task without sacrificing the motor control performance. This can be seen when the plot the step response dramatically change. For example, when we kept increasing the rate of the control, the motor would start to overshoot when reaching the setpoint. The effect was amplified if the period of control increased. We adjusted the rate for the motor control task to where the motor started to overshoot and decrease the rate until the overshoot was diminished. Then, we lowered the rate more to account for a factor of safety. Hence, we recommend run the motor with a flywheel for every 30 ms.
